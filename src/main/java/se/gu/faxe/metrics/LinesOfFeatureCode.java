/**
 * Lines of Feature Code: lines of code belonging to artifacts, either directly annotated,
 * or indirectly (when a folder is annotated, all descendants are taken into account)
 * =========================================================================================
 * Lines of Feature Code as defined by Liebig, JÃ¶rg et. al. (2010). An
 * Analysis of the Variability in Forty Preprocessor-Based Software Product Lines.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Lines of Feature Code (LOF). The LOF metric is the number lines of feature code that are
 * linked to feature expressions. It tells us whether a small or a large fraction of the
 * code base is variable. We extract this metric by counting the number of lines between
 * two #ifdefs in source code files and sum them per project.
 * =========================================================================================
 * In the context of FAXE this means that for a specific feature ALL annotated elements are
 * considered. I.e. on source code, feature-to-file mapping and feature-to-folder mapping
 * - For the calculation of Fragments (annotated code scopes), all lines from the &begin till
 *   &end line are considered.
 *   Example - 5 lines of fragment code
 *     //&begin[BlockchainSync]
 *     public final Date bestChainDate;
 *     public final int bestChainHeight;
 *     public final boolean replaying;
 *     //&end[BlockchainSync]
 *   This is for stability reasons to cover all ways of how text fragment annotations can be written.
 *     /*&begin[BlockchainSync] * /public final bestValue;
 *     public final Date bestChainDate;
 *     public final int bestChainHeight;
 *     public final boolean replaying;
 *     public final boolean play //&end[BlockchainSync]
